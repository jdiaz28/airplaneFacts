# airplaneFacts
Python program that pulls flight data and gives interesting facts from that data. Still a work in progress.

Using the flightradar24 library I was able to pull the flight data and build off of that.

## Issues
1. I think I improperly used flightradar24. Still learning... oops.
2. version2 coming soon
